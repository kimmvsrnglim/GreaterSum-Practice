Why tests? 
    Verify functionality 
    Defend against unexpected change 

Code Coverage 
    Shows percentage of lines that hit while test runs
    Doesn't say if it doing what it should do 
    Not covered % by tests are not working - this is where it is helpful

Add functionality to legacy code 
    
If test fails = mutant 
If test doesn't fait = no mutants 

Equivalant Mutant - these exists 

Mutation testing JS framework = Stryker 
If you want to kill all mutants = use Stryker 

Want to run code a lot during refactoring
Mutation testing helps test quality in test suite (when things change in the code - how does it test?)

Kill mutants with more tests

TDD builds quality tests that cover you. - Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)
