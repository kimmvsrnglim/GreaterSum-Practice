Unit testing - 
flexible, maintainable, reusable code

What is unit testing?
low level, focusing on small part of software system

How to write unit tests?
Arrange - a set up to mocks/data to run testing
Act - invoke code 

Common mistakes - 
    Not writing tests.
    Test passes, but not testing the correct feature 
        - try to make it fail to test this
        - test for boundary and edge cases (sometimes)
    Testing irrelevant things
    Testing multipe things in assertions 

Always ask 'why am I writing this test?' to keep test simplified
Ask about human errors that would happen as well
